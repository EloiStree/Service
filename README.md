# Service

I am a self-taught freelance developer with a focus on Unity3D and virtual reality since the Oculus DK1.  
I am not the best developer in quality or productivity but I have two main qualities:   
- I am creative and love to find solution  
- I am not doing this job because I want to live of it but becase I love coding all day long.  

A third quality I have is the patience to teach what ever the level of learner.  
I am French in mother tought, but can work and teach in English.


You can find the project I did in the past as experiments or small projects for clients:
https://github.com/EloiStree/Service/tree/main/Archive/Projects

I have been teaching for two years going from 1 day to 5 months straight.   
Tou can find some archived of the workshop here:    
https://github.com/EloiStree/Service/tree/main/Archive/Teaching  

Since I started to code, I never stopped.  
I have 80% of my time worked for me on hundreds of small experiments.  
And from time to time, I worked and teached for clients.  

The reason is simple, I am not working to live, I work to allow me to code more.  

You can find a list of the project on my harddrive here:

Feel free to contact me anytime if you want to work with me.  
  
May the code be with you,  
Kind regards, 
Eloi
